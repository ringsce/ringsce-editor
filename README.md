## Our Goals
Our goal for this project is to deliver an open source library for JSON, XML, and database for the openkrown engine.

## Database goals

Our database goals are to achieve a library capable to work with JSON and XML.

## Parser and reader
Here, we will find a parser and a reader for processing the data inside the openkrown data file folder. This library will be inside the data-dir folder. With this parser, we can manipulate the data from the zip content folder.
