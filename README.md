#  ringsce editor
This is an editor written with Lazarus IDE and free Pascal. Where you can use for ringsce repo to build the engine

## Our Goals
Our goal for this project is to deliver an open-source library for JSON, XML, and database for the ringssce engine.

## Database goals

Our database goals are to achieve a library capable of working with JSON and XML.

## Parser and reader
Here, we will find a parser and a reader for processing the data inside the openkrown data file folder. This library will be inside the data-dir folder. With this parser, we can manipulate the data from the zip content folder.
